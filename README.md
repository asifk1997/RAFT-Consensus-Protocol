# RAFT-Consensus-Protocol

This is my own implementation of [RAFT consensus protocol](https://raft.github.io/).

There are two versions i implemented one is based on the log files (original algorithm) -- raft_persistent.go

Other is modified without logs but works only on strong codition of majority being alive at any given point -- raft_volatile.go


There is one presentation file attached for further details.


Also There are this links to watch the demo.
